## **License Plate Detection and Recognition**  

### **Overview**  
ANPR-System (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) is a machine learning-based project designed to detect and recognize vehicle license plates from images or video streams. It utilizes **TensorFlow Object Detection API and OpenCV** to achieve accurate plate detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for character extraction.  

### **Features**  
✅ License plate detection using deep learning  
✅ OCR-based character recognition  
✅ Image and video input support  
✅ Pre-processing for improved accuracy  
✅ Error handling and debugging guide  

### **Tech Stack**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, Tesseract OCR  
- **Model**: MobileNetV2 (for object detection)  
- **Dataset**: Custom dataset for training
